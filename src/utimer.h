#define SHORTDESCRIPTION _("command-line \"timer\" which features a timer,\
 a countdown and a stopwatch")

#define SUMMARY _(" µTimer (or \"utimer\", pronounced as \"micro-timer\") is a\
 multifunction timer (command-line only).\n\n The main features are:\n\
\t- a timer (e.g. count from 0 to 4 minutes),\n\
\t- a countdown (e.g. count from 10 minutes down to 0),\n\
\t- a stopwatch.\
\n\n µTimer always exits after\
 the timer or countdown are done counting. This can be useful\
 for using countdowns in scripts, for example. The stopwatch, which is not\
 concerned, needs to be stopped manually using 'q'.")
