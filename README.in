Launchpad, at this address: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/utimer
Just fill the form with your idea or contribution and if we think this is a good
idea and that is well adapted to µTimer, we'll try to implement it or put it 
into the source code.

Usage
-----
The only function available in this version is the Timer.

Timer:

  To use the timer, you have to use the -t option. This option requires a time
  length to be given, like this:

  utimer -t 1h30m45s300ms

  The time length is composed of pairs of a value and a suffix, it can be in any
  order.
  The known suffixes are:

  d: days
  h: hours
  m: minutes
  s: seconds
  ms: milliseconds

  The value must be a positive integer and can be null.
  Here's a few examples of valid time lengths:

  10s300ms
  400ms
  2d
  15m1h
  0s0d87h451ms
  0ms
  
  You can also use the timer in scripts, like this for example:
  
  utimer -t 10m && wget www.mywebsite.com/myscript
  utimer -t 1d5h38m && reboot
  utimer -t 500ms && do_cpu_stuff && utimer -t 500ms && do_other_cpu_stuff
